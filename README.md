# Hi there, 🖐️ I’m Jehonathan!

### A passionate fullstack developer from the land of milk and honey!

My focus is on creating intuitive and scalable user experiences using technologies such as React, Node.js, and MongoDB. I am always learning and staying up to date with the latest development trends. 

In my free time, I enjoy discovering new music and working out 👟.
